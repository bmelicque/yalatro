# Yalatro

**Status: WIP**

This project is an open source game _heavily_ inspired by [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/), hence the name obviously. It uses dice however, taking from Yahtzee instead of poker.

## Installing

If you don't want to play it online (using the associated GitHub Page), you can install the dependencies, then run it:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Docs

The `docs` folder is actually the build folder, just a "hack" to host it on GitHub Pages.
